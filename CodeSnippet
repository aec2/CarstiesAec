Creating a custom surround-with code snippet in Visual Studio 2022 for diagnostics purposes, like measuring execution time, is a great way to streamline your development process. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### 1. Define the Snippet

First, you need to define the XML structure of your snippet. For timing diagnostics, you might want to include `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` to measure the execution time of a code block. Here's an example snippet definition:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<CodeSnippets xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005/CodeSnippet">
    <CodeSnippet Format="1.0.0">
        <Header>
            <Title>timeBlock</Title>
            <Shortcut>timeBlock</Shortcut>
            <Description>Code snippet for timing a block of code</Description>
            <Author>Your Name</Author>
            <SnippetTypes>
                <SnippetType>SurroundsWith</SnippetType>
            </SnippetTypes>
        </Header>
        <Snippet>
            <Declarations>
                <Literal>
                    <ID>codeToMeasure</ID>
                    <ToolTip>Place your code block here</ToolTip>
                    <Default>Your code here</Default>
                </Literal>
            </Declarations>
            <Code Language="csharp"><![CDATA[
var stopwatch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew();
$selected$ $end$
stopwatch.Stop();
Console.WriteLine($"Execution Time: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");
]]>
            </Code>
        </Snippet>
    </CodeSnippet>
</CodeSnippets>
```

### 2. Save the Snippet File

Save the XML file with a `.snippet` extension, for example, `TimeBlock.snippet`. You can save it in any directory, but Visual Studio has a default snippet directory you might use for convenience, typically found at:

- For your own user snippets: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets`

### 3. Import the Snippet into Visual Studio

To use the snippet in Visual Studio 2022, you need to import it:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to **Tools** > **Code Snippets Manager**.
3. Select **Visual C#** from the language drop-down menu.
4. Click **Import** and navigate to where you saved your `.snippet` file.
5. Select the snippet file and click **Open**.
6. Choose where to save the snippet (you can keep the default location) and click **Finish**, then **OK**.

### 4. Using the Snippet

To use your custom snippet:

1. Highlight the code block you want to surround with your diagnostic code.
2. Press `Ctrl+K, S` to open the "Surround With" menu.
3. Type the shortcut name for your snippet (in this example, `timeBlock`) or find it in the list and select it.

This wraps the selected code block with your timing code, inserting a `Stopwatch` to measure how long the block takes to execute.

Remember, the snippet above is a simple example. You can customize it further based on your specific needs, such as adding additional diagnostics information or formatting the output differently.
